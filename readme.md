# ITSE 1430 - Programming in C#

This repository is where your classwork and lab assignments will go.

## Getting Started

For prerequisites and instructions on setting up your machine please refer to the [Setup](https://github.com/michaeltccd/itse1430-docs/blob/master/setup/readme.adoc) section of the class documentation repository.

## Repository Layout

The repository is laid out in a way to make it easier for you to work with during class.

- `classwork` is where your daily classwork will go. Each time we do work in class you will push the work to this folder so you can refer to it later.
- `labs` is where your lab assignments will go. Each lab assignment will go into its own subfolder. It is from this folder that I will grade your lab assignments.
- `.editorconfig` is a style configuration file that Visual Studio uses to help guide styling of your code.
- `.git` is a core Git folder. Never touch or modify this folder. Doing so will potentially prevent you from syncing with Github.
- `.gitattributes` is a core Git file. Do not touch or remove this file.
- `.gitignore` is a core Git file. Do not touch or remove this file.
